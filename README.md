# Evolution-of-Genetic-Immune-Escape-Viewer
Immune escape is a critical hallmark of cancer progression, yet its evolutionary path largely remains unclear. When do genetic alterations in immunomodulatory pathways arise during cancer development? What precedes them, and what happens afterwards? We seek to build a pan-cancer atlas that maps the genetic evolution of immune escape. How can we get there?
